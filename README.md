# AWS Digital Thread Lab Implementation

## Overview
This repository documents my successful deployment and implementation of the AWS Digital Thread lab using graph and generative AI. The original lab is part of the AWS Solutions Library, and this project was undertaken for academic and learning purposes.

## Original Source
[AWS Solutions Library - Digital Thread Using Graph and Generative AI](https://github.com/aws-solutions-library-samples/guidance-for-digital-thread-using-graph-and-generative-ai-on-aws)

## Implementation Experience
I successfully deployed this solution, gaining valuable insights into Industry 4.0 concepts and their practical application using AWS services. The process involved setting up a digital thread architecture that integrates various data sources and leverages graph databases and generative AI.

### Challenges and Solutions
1. **Understanding Knowledge Graph Concepts**: I had to delve deep into how knowledge graphs populate their databases and create connections, learning about semantics, taxonomy, ontology, and related terms.
2. **Cost Management**: Keeping AWS service costs under control while implementing a complex solution was a significant challenge.
3. **Integration Complexity**: Connecting all the components to create an end-to-end application ready for user interaction required careful planning and execution.

### Key Learnings
- Gained practical experience with AWS services such as Neptune, Bedrock, and Lambda.
- Understood the importance of data integration in creating a comprehensive digital thread.
- Learned about the application of generative AI in manufacturing contexts.
- Developed skills in implementing graph databases for complex data relationships.
